We will use Osmium to extract the region of New York from OpenStreetMap. Then implement a system which will prompt the user
to give their location and ask for target location and then draw on the map the optimal path across road network.
Use AStar algorithm.
Use IO2D as a GIS renderer

TASKS:
1. Render and display the map

- Need a smaller map. Whole of NYC is too much to begin with.
